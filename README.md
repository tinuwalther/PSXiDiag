# PSXi

We currently have ~150 ESXi Hosts across 12 vCenters in our environemnt. Whenerver I'm done with the visualization of it, it's already wrong and I can start again. Why doesn't PowerShell do this for me? That's why I wrote this framework.

## PSXi Home Page

This is the Homepage of the PSXi App. It shows you the workflow of the data.

If you click on this page, all ESXi Hosts of the Cloud will be grouped by vCenterServer. The datas are stored in a SQLite database.
